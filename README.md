# Guess-the-Numer-LOLCODE
A classic "Guess the Number" game written in LOLCODE.
  

LOLCODE is an esoteric programming language designed to resemble "lolspeak".  
  
How to play:  
1. The program has a secret number (currently set to 42).  
2. The player is prompted to enter their guess.  
3. The program will tell the player if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.  
4. The game continues until the player guesses the secret number.  
5. The program then displays the number of tries it took.  
  
This program demonstrates variables, input/output, loops (`IM IN YR LOOP`), conditionals (`O RLY?`), and type casting in LOLCODE.
